Aiken-lang is a modern programming language designed for developing smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. The version 1.1.5 includes various features and improvements, particularly for NFT marketplace contracts.

For a comprehensive report, consider the following aspects:

### Smart Contract Examples: Look forNFT marketplace smart contracts and other relevant examples in the Aiken ecosystem.

  -Jpg Store: A well-known NFT marketplace contract available at Jpg Store.
  -Nebula: A Cardano NFT marketplace contract that includes a chain indexer and event listener for                individual projects, found at Nebula.   
  -Functions and Features: Analyze the functions specific to the new or old standard library versions.

### Standard Library: The official standard library for Aiken can be found at aiken-lang/stdlib.

  -Extensions: Additional libraries and extensions to the standard library are available, such as acca and aicone.
  -Dependencies: Identify the dependencies required for the smart contracts.

  -Core Dependencies: Ensure that the contracts utilize the latest versions of Aiken libraries and any other necessary dependencies.
  -Testing Libraries: Libraries like aiken-lang/fuzz for property-based testing and vodka for validation utilities.
### Bugs, Errors, and Issues: Document any known bugs or issues in version 1.1.5.

  -Common Errors: For example, an error related to unknown record fields, as seen in the provided code snippet where extra_signatures was incorrectly referenced instead of extra_signatories.
  -Compilation Issues: Ensure that the smart contracts compile without errors, as indicated by the testing results showing all tests passing.

  
### Improvement Reports: Suggest areas for improvement based on the current functionality and user feedback.

  -Developer Experience: Enhance error messages and documentation to improve the developer experience, drawing inspiration from languages like Rust and Elm.
  -Security Audits: Regularly conduct security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

  
### Version 1.1.5 Specific Reports: Summarize any specific changes or improvements made in version 1.1.5.

  -New Features: Highlight any new features introduced in this version that enhance functionality or usability.
  -Performance Enhancements: Report on any performance improvements that have been made to the Aiken language or its libraries.

  
By compiling this information, you can create a detailed report on Aiken-lang smart contracts, particularly focusing on NFT marketplace contracts and the specifics of version 1.1.5
