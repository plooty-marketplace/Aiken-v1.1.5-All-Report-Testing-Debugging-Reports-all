4. Bugs, Errors, and Issues

### Common Issues:
Ensure that the caller has sufficient balance before purchasing an NFT.

Error handling could be improved to provide better feedback to users.

5. Improvement Reports

-Error Messages: Improve error handling to provide clear messages when actions cannot be completed (e.g., insufficient funds, NFT not found).
-Security Audits: Regularly conduct audits of the smart contract to identify vulnerabilities, especially regarding fund transfers.
-User Experience: Consider adding events to log significant actions like NFT minting, listing, and purchases for better tracking and user feedback.
